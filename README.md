Dash is an essential tool for developers that combines instant API documentation access with powerful snippet management. It supports hundreds of docsets including Python, JavaScript, React, Swift, and many others—all available offline. You’ll never need to open a browser again to check documentation.

With Dash, you can save, organize, and quickly insert code snippets using custom keywords. The app integrates with virtually every major code editor and supports syncing across devices via iCloud. Its clean, native macOS interface ensures a smooth and responsive experience, even with large documentation sets.

Whether you're a student, freelancer, or part of a development team, Dash helps you stay focused and productive. It reduces context-switching, accelerates learning, and keeps your coding workflow streamlined and efficient.
